# MuscleFreqResp
Frequency Response Calculation for Numerical Muscle Models

This repository contains the source code used in the paper:

> Frequency Response Characterization of Numerical Hill-Type Muscle Models
> Journal of Biomechanics, 2025

The code implements the frequency response analysis of numerical muscle models as described in the Methods section.

Implemented in MATLAB based on the dynamic equations presented in D. G. Thelen (2003).

MATLAB implementation from M. Millard (2013) was adopted, using the original MATLAB code publicly released by the author.

The main MATLAB scripts for frequency response analysis and Bode plot generation were developed by the present authors for this study.
