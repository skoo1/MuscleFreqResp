Frequency Response Calculation for Numerical Muscle Models

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of two numerical Hill-type muscle models and scripts for frequency response analysis as described in our submitted manuscript (Journal of Biomechanics, in submission).

## Muscle Models

- **Thelen Muscle Model (TMM)**  
  Implemented in MATLAB based on the dynamic equations presented in:  
  Thelen, D. G. (2003). Adjustment of muscle mechanics model parameters to simulate dynamic contractions in older adults. *Journal of Biomechanical Engineering*, 125(1), 70â€“77.

- **Millard Muscle Model (MMM)**  
  MATLAB implementation from M. Millard (2013) was adopted, using the original MATLAB code publicly released by the author:  
  https://github.com/mjhmilla/Millard2012EquilibriumMuscleMatlabPort

## Main Scripts

The main MATLAB scripts for frequency response analysis and Bode plot generation were developed by the present authors for this study.
